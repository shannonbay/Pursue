                An invite code is a unique code for a group (e.g. <code class="bg-pursue-gray-100 px-1 rounded">PURSUE-ABC123-XYZ789</code>). Group members can generate and share it from the group's <strong>Invite Members</strong> screen — they can copy the code, share it via messaging or social apps, or share a link (getpursue.app/invite/CODE). Anyone with the code or link can join that group. By default, invite codes don't expire and have unlimited uses; admins can change these settings.

Each goal is either <strong>Binary</strong> (yes/no — e.g. "Did you meditate?") or <strong>Numeric</strong> (distance, time, or count — e.g. "Run 3x per week", "Read 30 pages", "Miles per month"). Admins create goals and choose the cadence and metric type; members log progress against them. Examples: daily habits (meditate, run), weekly targets (gym 3x, call parents), monthly milestones (read 2 books), yearly goals (run marathon).

Use <strong>Copy</strong> to copy the code, or <strong>Share</strong> to send it via your apps. You can also copy a link (getpursue.app/invite/CODE) so friends can open it on their phone and join. Any member can invite; you don't need to be an admin.

                Check your internet connection. If you see "No internet connection" or "Offline — showing cached data," the app is using cached data and will sync when you're back online. Try <strong>pull to refresh</strong> on the Home or Today screen to fetch the latest data. If you see a "Server error" or "Request timed out," wait a moment and try again. If sync still fails, force-quit the app and reopen it, or log out and back in.

                Ensure app notifications are enabled in your device settings (Settings → Apps → Pursue → Notifications). Pursue sends push notifications when someone in your group logs progress, when a new member joins, and when group details change. If you've just installed or reinstalled, sign in again so the app can register for notifications. On some devices, battery saver or "optimization" can block background delivery — try allowing Pursue to run in the background if notifications still don't appear.

If you're using a link, open it on the same phone where you have (or will install) Pursue — invite links are meant to open the app or the store. If the code was shared a while ago, the group admin may have changed or disabled the invite; ask for a fresh code or link.
