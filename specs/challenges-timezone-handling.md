**Timezone-safe challenge transitions:** All challenge status transitions and phase schedule updates should use conservative timezone offsets to ensure no user is ever cut short. For "start" transitions (upcoming→active, phase schedule advancing), compare against the current date in UTC+14 (the world's earliest timezone — Line Islands, Kiribati). For "end" transitions (active→completed), compare against the current date in UTC-12 (the world's latest timezone — Baker Island). Concretely, in the scheduled job: flip upcoming→active when NOW() >= challenge_start_date at UTC+14 (i.e., challenge_start_date - interval '14 hours' in UTC), and flip active→completed when NOW() > challenge_end_date at UTC-12 (i.e., challenge_end_date + interval '36 hours' in UTC). For progressive goal phase transitions, use the same UTC+14 trigger so the server-side goal title/target updates as soon as the first timezone in the world enters the new phase day. The client should also receive the full phase_schedule JSONB in the API response and compute the display title/target locally from the user's own local date, treating the server's goal title as a fallback. This approach requires only offset changes in the existing scheduled job comparisons while guaranteeing correctness for all inhabited timezones.

**Completion notification timing:** The server status flip to completed (at the UTC-12 safe boundary) should not trigger notifications directly. Instead, when the status flips, the job should queue completion notifications for each member individually, scheduled to send during that user's local daytime window — using the same timing infrastructure as smart reminders (i.e., the user's stored timezone and typical active hours, or a default of 9:00 AM local if no pattern exists). This means a user in NZ who finished the challenge on their March 30 might receive the "🎉 Challenge Complete!" notification at 9:00 AM NZDT on March 31, while a user in LA receives theirs at 9:00 AM PDT on March 31. The completion card and stats should be available immediately in-app (the client can locally detect the challenge ended), but the push notification respects quiet hours.

**Client-side challenge status:** The API continues to return the server's challenge_status field as-is (which uses conservative UTC+14/UTC-12 boundaries for transitions). The Android client should not use challenge_status directly for display purposes. Instead, the client computes the user-facing status locally: if the user's local date is before challenge_start_date, show "upcoming"; if between challenge_start_date and challenge_end_date inclusive, show "active" with the day counter (local_date - challenge_start_date + 1); if after challenge_end_date, show "completed." The server's challenge_status is still used for server-side concerns (resource limit queries, notification job eligibility, scheduled transitions), but the client treats the raw dates as the source of truth for everything the user sees — status label, progress bar, day count, and phase schedule phase. This avoids any API changes and eliminates timezone display bugs entirely.
